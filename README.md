# Bali Tower Defence Game

The bali tower defence game is a Unity3D game made by 9 students at the [Grafisch Lyceum Utrecht](https://glu.nl) in the Netherlands as a last artist-developer combined project. The goal of the project was to create a game that would be playable inside of a museum and easily accessable.

# The assignment and story

The assignment tasked students to go towards a museum of choice and base a game on an exposition or activity. Our group thought it would be a challenging idea to tell a story about a culture through a tower defence game and we ended up going to the Museum of Volkenkunde in Leiden to find an exposition about Bali. We were all hooked.

One particular statue caught our interest, it depicted the Hindu goddess Durga slaging the buffalo demon Mahishasura.

The legend goes that long ago Mahishasura gained immortality by longtime servitude of Hindu god Brahma, but started abusing it as soon as he got it. To defeat him and his army of minions, Brahma, Vishu and Shiva created the war goddess avatar of Parashakti, also known as Devi Durga. Together with her tiger mount, they set out to slay the Demon.

For this assigment a lot of research was done about the customs, architecture, mythology and art of the island of Bali to try and stay as faithful as possible to the source material and respectfully appreciate the culture of Bali.
